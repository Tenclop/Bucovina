    <p>The Seat Fortress of Suceava, also known as the Fortress of Suceava, is a medieval fortress located on the eastern edge of the city of Suceava (in northeastern Romania). It is located on a terminal spur of a plateau at a height of 70 m from the Suceava meadow. From here, you can see the entire valley of Suceava. It is preferred to use the term of the Citadel of Suceava and not of the Citadel of Suceava, because in Suceava there were two fortresses: the Citadel of Scave and the Citadel of the West (Cetatea Șcheia), both being built by the voivode Petru I Mușat (c. 1375 - c. 1391).The fortress was built at the end of the 14th century by Peter I Musat, was fortified in the 15th century by Stephen the Great and destroyed in the 17th century (1675) by Dumitrașcu Cantacuzino. Currently, the Suceava Fortress is in ruins.  </p>

        <p>Short History</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-voro">
<p>In 1388, the voivode Petru I Mușat (1375-1391) moved the capital of the Principality of Moldavia from the city of Siret to the city of Suceava. The voivode was married to the sister of the king of Poland, Vladislav II Iagello (1386-1434).
    As a result of archaeological research conducted here in the second half of the twentieth century, several stages of construction of the fortress were identified. No previous fortifications have been identified here, resulting in the first fortified construction dating from the reign of Peter I Musat. Archaeological research has determined that there was a clump of forest here that was cleared by arson in order to raise the building. The dating of the construction is also due to the discovery of several dozen silver coins (all issued by the mint of voivode Peter I Musatin) in the oldest level of the fortress.  </p>
