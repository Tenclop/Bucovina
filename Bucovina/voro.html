        <p>The Voronet Monastery is a medieval monastery in the Romanian village of Voronet, now a part of the town Gura Humorului. It is one of the famous painted monasteries from southern Bukovina, in Suceava County. The monastery is located to the south of Gura Humorului in Suceava County, in the valley of the Voronet River. The legend of the origin of the church unites two men central to Romanian history: the founder of the monastery, Stephen the Great, and Saint Daniil the Hermit, the first abbot of the monastery. The tomb of Saint Daniil is located within the monastery.</p>
