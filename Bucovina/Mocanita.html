    <p>Mocanita, the narrow-gauge train that runs in the mountain regions has a long history in our country. These local trains were used to transport goods, especially wood, but also to transport passengers. In the localities on the hills of Bucovina, on the banks of the Moldovita River, near the mountains Obcina Mare and Obcina Feredeu, time stands still.

        It is the Land of the Hutus, ethnic Ukrainians living in these areas, but also in Maramures, Transcarpathia or Pocutia. The 150-horse locomotive of Mocanita Hutulca walks you through this land for about 30 minutes. The name Mocanita certainly comes from the Hutus villagers who named it Mocanita Hutulca. </p>

    <div class="info-voro">
    <p>The narrow-gauge railway from Moldovita was built by a sawmill owner from Munich, Louis Ortieb. Mocanita Hutulca was put into use in 1888 to transport wood from the forest to the sawmill.

    The line is taken over, in 1909, by the church fund. It makes changes and reduces the gauge from standard 800 millimeters to 760 millimeters. The route of Mocanita was, initially, 23.9 kilometers and moved from Moldovita to Pdurea Rososa. Over the years, changes have been made, and in 1987 the Rascova-Rasca right section and Arsuri were put into operation on a length of 73 kilometers.Until 2001, the Moldovita line was used to transport timber. Starting with the summer of 2005, the line is administered by the Association for the Preservation of Narrow Lines in Romania and has 10.5 kilometers. </p>
