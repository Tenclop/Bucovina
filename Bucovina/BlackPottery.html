        <p> Marginea pottery is a typical ceramic brand for Marginea commune in Suceava county. It is characterized both by the black color that objects acquire after burning - the result of using a prehistoric technology, and by ornaments - the result of using specific techniques or by preserving traditional shapes. The technology by which the pots at Marginea are obtained is that of suppressed combustion (reducing) and polishing with the help of a flint. The earth from which the pots are made is brought by potters from the edge of the village and burned in ovens for about 9 hours so that the black smoke enters the pots and thus gives them the typical black color.  </p>

        <p>Short History</p>

    <div class="info-voro">
<p>Marginea pottery appears as a result of the use of a production technology belonging to the Horodistea - Floresti culture (the most flourishing period of black Geto-Dacian pottery).

    In the XII-XV centuries the pottery activity experienced a strong development in the north of Moldova and especially in the region. Before the establishment of the communist regime in Romania, there were about 60 potters' workshops in Marginea. Then, in the years of communism, the possession of a potter's wheel was punished by law and for this reason many potters gave up their trades inherited from their ancestors. Later, however, the communists also tried to relaunch this activity through artisanal cooperatives. </p>
